# Sitting_Posture_Detector
This is project developed during first year of graduation in Innovation Project. In this project, we have used different electronics components, Arduino, and C++ to get the perfect sitting posture of the person sitting on chair.

In this sitting posture will be detected based on force given by the back-bone to the lower-back part of the chair-rest and it even depends on distance that between central shoulder part and upper-back part of the chair-rest.
